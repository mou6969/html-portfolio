<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Moustafa Abdelaziz, and I’m a highly motivated Computer Engineering student currently entering my final year of undergraduate studies. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in software development, computer systems, and problem-solving—skills that I’m eager to apply and expand upon in a professional setting.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve taken a deep dive into Full Stack Web Development, where I’m learning how to build dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. This website is a reflection of my progress and passion—it features projects I’ve worked on as part of my coursework, as well as personal initiatives that go beyond the classroom. I believe in continuous growth, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks to challenge myself and improve my skill set.</p>

<p>My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer who not only writes clean, efficient code but also understands the bigger picture—how systems interact, how users engage with technology, and how software can solve real-world problems. I value teamwork, clear communication, and a strong work ethic, and I’m excited to contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my site. If you’re looking for a driven, adaptable, and enthusiastic soon-to-be graduate who is eager to learn and grow in a professional environment, I’d love to connect and discuss any opportunities you may have.</p>
